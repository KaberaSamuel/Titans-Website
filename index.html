        <h2>How we will do it</h2>
        <p>
          Firstly, we will raise awareness (by campaigns), so that parents and
          students can know exciting careers in the TVET sector <br />

          Secondly, we will work with the government of Rwanda to find a way to
          lower the costs of TVET programs, so that more people can afford them.
