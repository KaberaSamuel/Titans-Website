          Titans: The Rwanda's Modern Art Training center. We provide
          professional art programs to our students. We follow a hybrid model
          where our students spend less time with their coachs, and spend more
          in their workshops trying new stuffs and practicing what they've
          learnt. In addition to classroom sessions, each student assigned a
          mentor who is an expert in the respective fieldâ€”who we guide the
          student learning journey. We've also build a gallery dedicated to our
          students/alumni artworks. Our current programs are about physical
          art,i.e., Drawing, paintings, sculpting Painting and Computer art.
          Then we also digital art programs, those are 2D & 3D animations and
          modeling.

          At icreate Rwanda we've completely transformed how we approach
          students across different programs. We don't just teach how to draw,
          paint or animate, We also teach the right mindset a professional
          artist should have. We cultivate an imaginative and creative mindset
          in our students.
